**FoodOil IQ** is an intelligent, data-driven solution designed to assess the quality of edible cooking oil used in food preparation. It focuses on detecting oil degradation, contamination, and the effects of repeated use, which are often difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. By leveraging analytical and computational techniques, FoodOil IQ aims to improve food safety, support health standards, and help restaurants, food vendors, and households make informed decisions about oil usage and replacement.
